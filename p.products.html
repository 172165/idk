<p class="h1">
Paragon is a safe, fun and exciting environment for your child's personal development.<br>

We have helped hundreds of children over the years to increase their Confidence, Focus, Discipline, Concentration and Respect, all whilst teaching them the skills of Self Defence.<br>

Whilst physical skills are of great importance, at Paragon Academy we believe that Martial Arts taught correctly is a great way to help children develop important life skills.<br>

</p>
<h3 style="color:white" class="h1">paragon adults</h3>
<p class="h1">
It's never too late to learn Martial Arts and here at Paragon the personal development of each and every member, from the youngest to the oldest, is of prime importance.<br>

With our Freestyle Martial Arts classes you can not only learn kickboxing & Karate, you will also learn about pressure points. <br>

We also run boxing classes and additional sparring classes for those members who want to develop their skills and techniques further or have an interest in competing at tournament level.<br>
</p>
<h3 style="color:white" class="h1">paragon strength and conditioning</h3>
<p class="h1">
Paragon 'Strength & Conditioning' classes are more than just lifting weights. <br>

These no-nonsense sessions are great for really shaping and toning the body.  You'll work with a strength & conditioning coach and push yourself to achieve many great things with your body and mind.<br>

These classes are extremely popular and can be a stand alone class or combined with our Martial Arts program.<br>

<h3 style="color:white" class="h1">paragon sparring</h3>
<p class="h1">
At Paragon, Sparring* is introduced to all students of orange belt and above. It is a great way to improve your fighting technique in a controlled and safe environment.<br>

This is a great class to attend as it sharpens your technique, improves speed, awareness & distance, and is a good all rounder for performance.  This is where many students decide whether they want to go on to compete at 'competition' level or to remain sparring at club level.<br>

*This is not compulsory and students do not have to spar.<br>
